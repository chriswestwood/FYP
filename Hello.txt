This program is the FYP that I created for University.
It revolves around creating a story from its aspects; Characters , Items , Plot etc.
After a story is created it is then usable inside a game environment that utilises these aspects within the game
mechanics, so as the game never has to worry about the story.
And so the game maker also doesn't have to concentrate on the story either. 
These stories can also be passed around to different game environments.
